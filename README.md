## Dependencies
Please check package.json inside Oasis.
Then use: $ npm install <dependencies_name>

Also make sure to change port = 3000 when running in your local environment

You will also need my sql database connection. Currently you are directly connected to the AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) which requires internet connection.

when all the dependencies are installed, run : $ node search.js
